CLOG The Manual - a user manual for creating applications with CLOG

We need a solid user manual:

Getting Started

Getting started with common Lisp (Loading sbcl on local machine, mobile or servers)
Setting up a dev environment using emacs or the builder (which allows for your work flow on a server)
Pointers to getting started quick with CL and CLOG
Package management OCICL and QuickLisp
(BTW CLOG 3 will have a more IDE like IDE than the builder but not waiting on anything for documentation, CLOG's API is stable almost 5 years and only going to be adding, like a few macros and APIs to bind easier to JS patterns like promises)

CLOG Application Creation

Basics - create-* pattern and used of properties
Using html to layout binding by id
2, Using panels - creating manually and with the builder, using panels as templates
Using html grides to layout panels
Using CSS affectively
Access control
Restoring sessions
CLOG Application Delivery

Traditional Websites
Web application
Desktop applications
Mobile applications
Embedded devices
That is a quick initial list, maybe I should create a repo for collaboration on creating this.

Security and CLOG

Net security in general
Application security
